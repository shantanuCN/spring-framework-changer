 * Batch update callback interface used by the {@link JdbcTemplate} class.

 * by the JdbcTemplate class, for each of a number of updates in a batch using the
 * same SQL. Implementations are responsible for setting any necessary parameters.
 * SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <i>do not</i> need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions
 * that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will
 * catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.
